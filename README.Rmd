# decayr

The goal of decayr is to demonstrate the use of a niche gaussian decay function, for the purposes of demonstrating how to use GitHub when making an R package.

## Installation

You can install decayr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njtierney/decayr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(decayr)

gauss_decay(d_kj = 99,
            d_0 = 100)

gauss_decay(d_kj = 1,
            d_0 = 100)

```
